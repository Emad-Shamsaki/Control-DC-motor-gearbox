# Control-DC-motor-gearbox
A DC motor + gearbox and a voltage driver have been modeled using Model Based Design. For more information about the modeling a DC motor and a gearbox, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_jro4OaAyNVYlFRypAhWWIBzM5TxoYP/view?usp=sharing).

Two approaches of controlling has been implemented here. 

The first approach is PID which is one of the most famous control approaches in the industries.

The second approach is robust control by using the state space control. This approach is useful when we are not sure about the dynamic of our system.
